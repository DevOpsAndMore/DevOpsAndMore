**Continuous Integration** is the practice of merging all the code that is being produced by developers. The merging usually takes place several times a day in a shared repository. From within the repository, or production environment, building and automated testing are carried out that ensure no integration issues and the early identification of any problems.

**Continuous Delivery** adds that the software can be released to production at any time, often by automatically pushing changes to a staging system. 

**Continuous Deployment** goes further and pushes changes to production automatically.
